# Core objectives

* To be able to offer another role-playing avenue
	* Flavour
	* Risk
	* Reward
* Mechanically simple (only consumables)
* Time, Money, and Power
	* Time is a campaign construct
		* I do not want to impose expectations regarding 'length of downtime'
			* Things would instead be measured as (one downtime, two downtime, etc)
			* With the restriction of location
	* Money is a campaign commonality
		* This is based on the assumption that magic items can be procured, at '_sane_' prices, at reasonable locations
			* This is therefore not an attempt to circumvent item rarity.  Specifically, if a consumable magic item is hard to come by, or requires a task, then so too do the components to craft one
	* Power is scaled
		* Features and items which are only relevant at loIr-tier are less interesting
		* This must also be balanced - over-powered items are a threat to fun
# Existing rules (sources of inspiration, and criticism)
 
## Basic example - the humble healing potion

I'll compare four ways of acquiring a base-line healing potion.
___Short summary: there is often little risk and less reward.  Several of the options include time as a reward, which I will not consider.___

### Option one - buying
https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure
* standard is 2d4+2
- cost: 50 gp
- this can scale (ex: greater is 4d4+4, uncommon; listed as 150 in _sane_)
### Option two - Artificer (Alchemist sub-class) - class feature 
https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/tcoe/artificer#ExperimentalElixir
- 2d4+int
- cost: 1st-level spell slot, no material component
- limited 'shelf-life' to a single long rest
- potentially _mildly_ better than the 'common' potion... (only online at level 3, so probably a +1/+2)
- this does not scale
	- expending a higher level slot does not give an improved potion
### Option three - Dmg crafting ("_Crafting a Magic Item_")
https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/betIen-adventures#CraftingaMagicItem
- rules seem focused on controlling their posession by the party (even consumables)
- minimum level (3rd for common)
- 50 gp for consumable common magic item (like a potion)
- takes 2 days (25gp per day)
- "you are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign"
- follows man-month/dog-piling rules (several characters can contribute to the same project)
- ***this costs just as much as buying one***
	- only relevant if the dm wants to add a hurdle, but confers no benefit or risk
	- this is mechanically boring... and players would be free to rp this anyways...
### Option four - Xanathar's crafting ("_Downtime revisisted_")
https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#CraftinganItem
- "_In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the itemâ€™s selling cost._"
- okay, an initial benefit of saving money (1/2 price of the dmg)
- not incredibly compelling, but better than before
- hoIver, it also reworks the timeframe (now takes even longer - 50gp for a Iek)
- disappointing... not sure of the rationale
- so, two days to create a full price one, or a Iek to create a 1/2 price one
- addresses (somewhat) the man-month/dog-piling issue
- "_A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment._"
- this is good... it wasn't stated outright before (instead just requiring you to be a spell caster)
- "_Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item._"
- this is also good... making it just skill/proficiency rolls would be boring... but combining the two seems interesting...
- even gives some cool examples, comparing the CR associated with the 'monster ingredient' and the cost with the actual crafting, ex:

| Item Rarity | CR Range of Monster Ingredients | Consumable Crafting cost |
| ---  | --: | --: |
| Common | 1-3 | 25gp |
| Uncommon | 4-8 |200 gp| 

- also introduces 'complications', which are interesting
- reward is 1/2 price... (no power adjustment)
- this doesn't quite scale though
	- (their price for uncommon consumable would be 100gp, which is 2/3 original... and would take 2 weeks...) 
- lack of power adjustment is somewhat disappointing
	- ex: someone with 'expertise' in tools/skills... who has the help of team to gather (dangerous to acquire) components should get something better than 1/2 price store-shelf 
### Option PF2E: 
https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft/
- includes the concept of a spell to replace...
	- perhaps this could be used to assist instead (ex: 'mending', 'prestigitation', 'mage-hand' to help)
- includes the concept of tool quality
- cost is 1/3 material (rather than 1/2 specified by XGTE)
- dc for 'average' mundane item (common, non-magical armour/Iapon) is 15...
	- time taken is a formula btw dc and roll, compared against price of item
		- (higher roles meaning that the item can be completed in less time)
			- poorer rolls can waster materials... (potentially requiring more investment)
- the incentive here is primarily about time, with the risk being cost
- interesting things, but not compelling...

## Take-aways
* Time (as either reward or input) is not considered
	* Time-frame should fit the adventure
	* Long-rest in appropriate location seems simple enough
* Magic as an input is interesting (rather than a replacement)
	* many possible cantrips (create bonfire, mage hand, prestigitation, mending, etc)
* Having a shelf-life for crafted potions is interesting
* Limit dog-piling, but don't restrict teamwork
	* up to 3 people on a single item, each with a single contributing effort (ex: only a single spell or skill), over the course of a long-rest seems acceptable
* Desire to scale our creations
	* The reward should reflect the challenge and risk
* Upgrading tools/workshop is interesting, but could perhaps also be accomplished with existing stuff
	* instead, utilize the combination of existing tools
		* ex: requiring the usage of herbs from a healer's kit, or the rake/pick from thieves' tools, etc.
# Mechanics

Will probably be something akin to the poison stuff I wrote....

- 3 aspects
	- the adventure/hunt (risk/reward)
		- just doing this anyways?
		- incorporating 'monster hunter' is a completely separate game (though compelling for some)...
		- perhaps rumours/tips/guides need to be involved
	- the harvesting (risk/reward)
	- the crafting (risk/reward)
- this compounds the risk/reward...
# Comparing numbers

* what should the base chance of 'success' be?
	* success: full-price consumable
		* this is boring, so let's say that is 100% (rp only... "_sure, you didn't buy that, you made it_")
	* enhanced-success:
		* let's make the variables bounded (bound this by ability modifier, or proficiency bonus)
			* I'll look at the different tiers
				* 'Fizzabella' is a good example - a Gnome Rogue
					* (even she isn't 100% min-maxed though, but we can see the highest mundane proficiency being +17)
						* I'll compare this with the potions:
							* supreme healing (very rare): **10d4 + 20** (~40)
							* superior healing (rare): **8d4 + 8** (~26)
							* greater healing (uncommon): **4d4 + 4** (~12)
							* healing (common): **2d4 + 2** (4)
						* if we applied that +17 to the basic healing potion, it would put it in line with the 'superior' one (not even top-tier)
						* but... there are ways we can improve ability checks - what if casters supported the crafting, what would happen? (ignoring unrelated skills, like stealth, athletics, charisma, etc)
							* Bardic Inspiration: d12
							* Guidance: d4
							* Warlock - Fiend: d10
							* Warlock - Amulet: d4
							* Warlock - Peace: d4
							* Artificer  - Flash: +5 (int)
							* Human - Mark of Making: d4
							* Associated potential range:
								* 11-43
								* I think this would fall under dog-piling, or mythical-man-month, so would make the following restrictions:
									* no more than 3 on any single item project
									* each participant can only add a single bonus
								* that top 3 would then look like:
									* 8-27
									* still substantial
								* let's try comparing this as a (maxed) buff to the baseline potion
									* ~4+17+27 = ~48
									* this is better than the 40 offered by the top tier potion, but not in a crazy way (25% more doesn't seem unreasonable)
										* as that is completely maxed with the top rolls, we probably have more wiggle room
